# # {Teen Pregnancy and Sex Education in the US}üìù
# 
# ![Banner](./assets/banner.jpeg)

# ## Topic
# *What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# I am addressing the problem of teen pregnancy in the United States and examining if and how it relates to a lack of sex education. 

# ## Project Question
# *What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?*
# *This is not the same as the questions you ask to limit the scope of the project.*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# The specific question I am seeking to answer with this project is: "Is there a correlation between lack of sex education and increased teen pregnancy?"

# ## What would an answer look like?
# *What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# An answer could be expressed with a visualization such as a table or a bar chart showcasing the states with the highest and lowest teen pregnancy numbers, their overall population, and  their policies surrounding sex education. 
# 
# The answer itself would be: "Yes/No, there is/isn't strong evidence to suggest increased teen pregnancy directly correlates to a lack of sex education." 

# ## Data Sources
# *What 3 data sources have you identified for this project?*
# *How are you going to relate these datasets?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# My datasets are:
# - CDC Wonder (https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D149;jsessionid=C8DCABB90CDF366055F96EA1D525 and https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D192;jsessionid=70DEF061E23E358712E1506B71DF). This is a query based data source that allows you to view birth rates with different filters. I have imported the 2016-2024 and 2024-2025 natality datasets. 
# 
# - The United States Census (https://data.census.gov/table?q=teen+population+by+state&y=2024). This is united states census data filtered to focus on teens aged 15-19. 
# 
# - Parents Defending Education: Sex Education Laws By State (https://actionpde.org/sex-education-laws-by-state/). This is a website showcasing sex education laws by state. I have downloaded the website data as a PDF and extracted the raw text using pdfplumber. 
# 
# I will relate these datasets by state. When applicable, I will also use year, "Mandate Sex Ed" (Sex Education Laws By State), and age. 

# ## Approach and Analysis
# *What is your approach to answering your project question?*
# *How will you use the identified data to answer your project question?*
# üìù <!-- Start Discussing the project here; you can add as many code cells as you need -->
# 
# My approach will be to:
# - Calculate the average and raw teen pregnancy rate per state using census population numbers and CDC natality data. (This step had to be delayed due to issues with the census website)
# 
# - Extract data from the Sex Education Laws by State site and convert it into a usable table, including whether sex education is required and how comprehensive it is. 
# 
# - Connect datasets by year and when applicable "Mandate Sex Ed" and/or age. 
# 
# - Explore visualizations to illustrate the data and results.

# ## Checkpoint 2: Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization - Data Cleaning and Transformation
# 
# For checkpoint 2, I created three dataframes using my state laws PDf, my 2016-2024 natality data, and my 2025 natality data.  Then, I created four basic visualizations to showcase the organized data.  My plans moving forward are to create a fourth dataframe with my U.S. census data (the website is currently not updating due to the government shutdown. I had planned to change the filters on this dataset before cleaning and creating my dataframe, but I will save it for the next checkpoint.)
# 
# - First, I configured the PDF into usable data (below). This was done by extracting the raw text from the PDF document, splitting the raw text into lines, then putting the answers to the questions I need into a dataframe. I'm currently only using Q1 (Does the state mandate sex ed?) and Q2 (Does the state have an opt-in/opt-out policy?) to make the dataframe creation process quicker. This process may be changed later if I decided to add the answers to other questions on the document to my dataset. 
# 
# - Scroll down to see the data cleaning and transformation of my remaining sources + my visualizations. The steps I took and a detailed description/analysis of each visualization is below the data transcormation code blocks. 

# In[ ]:


#Configuring the PDF into usable data.

import pandas as pd

#Splitting my text into lines
lines = pdf_full_text_v3.strip().split('\n')
if lines[0].lower().startswith("state"):
    lines = lines[1:]
#Creating my dataframe
data = [line.split(maxsplit=2) for line in lines if line.strip()]
StateLawDF = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=["State", "Mandates Sex Ed?", "Opt-in/Opt-out Policy?"])

#Testing the PDF Dataframe
#print(pdf_full_text_v3)
#print(StateLawDF)
#print(StateLawDF["Mandates Sex Ed?"].value_counts())
#print(StateLawDF["State"].value_counts())


# - Next, I cleaned my Natality, 2016-2024 expanded-2 excel document (below). I abbreviated the state names to match the Sex-Education-State-Laws document, simplified the "State of Residence" header to "State", and created a dataframe with my cleaned data.

# ## Checkpoint 2: Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization - Data Visualization and EDA
# 
# Two visualization libraries used: Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
# 
# Write up of the data below:
# 
# **Visualization #1:** Count of states (50 states + DC) mandating sex-ed by answer (yes, no, partial)
# - This visualization was created to test out my dataframe + show the counts of how many states (plus DC) have mandated sex-ed policies. "Partial" refers to states that have sex-ed mandated, but is not all comprehensive (for example, they could teach about STDs, but not about safe sex practices). 
# - This visualization illustrates that the majority of states (41/50) have at least some kind of sex-ed policy. This data will be used with the natality (and eventually U.S. census data) to visualize correlations between mandated sex-ed and teen pregancies. 
# 
# **Visualization #2:** Count of states (50 states + DC) by opt-in/opt-out policy type (opt-in, opt-out, no policy)
# - This visualization shows how many states have an opt-in/opt-out policy, meaning the parents can request for their children to be included or excluded from sex-ed.  
# - Interestingly, the number of states with no opt-in/out policy is 8.  I'd like to compare this figure with the states mandating sex-ed to see which states have no opt-in policy, since 10 states have no mandated sex ed.
# - This raises the question, are there any states that both have no mandated sex-ed and have an opt-in/out policy? This seems contradictory and could point to some problems in how I cleaned my data, so I should go back and compare these numbers. 
# 
# **Visualization #3:** Line graph showing trend of births from 2016 to 2025. This line graph showcases the natality data from the 2016-2024 and 2023-2025 datasets. 
# - This is a double line graph showing the count of births per state for each of the natality datasets.  The datasets seem to follow the same trends, which is a goos sign because it means there were likely no major policy changes between years that were missed. 
# - The 2023-2025 data shows lower peaks than the 2016-2024 data. This raises questions about what changed during this time to lower the teen birth rate (quarantine due to Covid-19, smaller dataset, etc?)
# - The line chart shows the highest peaks in California and Texas. What's causing these peaks, what are their state policies, etc?
# 
# **Visualization #4:** Bar chart showing top 10 states with highest teen births from 2023-2025, whether they have a mandated sex ed policy, and whether they have an opt-in/opt-out policy
# - Shockingly, the only state in the top 10 with no mandated sex-ed is the #1 state, Texas.  This state has astronomically higher rates of teen pregnancy than any of the other states, and the hex pattern indicates that it also has an opt-out policy. 
# - Of the remaining nine, four only have partial mandated sex-ed and five have mandated sex ed.  All of them have opt-out policies. 
# - I plan do find out what the opt-out policy is for TX if there is no mandated sex-ed. It's likely to opt-out when sex-ed is offered even when it's not mandated. 
# - I also plan to repeat this process with the top 10 states with the lowest teen preganancy rates and compare results. 
# 
# - This visualization was the most difficult to get right, and originally I planned to show it as two different visualizations (top states by mandate policy and top states by opt in/out policy).
# 
# The sources I used for this visualization (matplotlib tutorials): 
# - https://pythonguides.com/transparent-plot-backgrounds-and-legend-styling-matplotlib-python/
# - https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/shapes_and_collections/hatch_style_reference.html
# - https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/customizing.html
# 
# 
# **Visualization #5:** This visualization is a bar chart merging the 2025 natality dataset with the state laws dataset by State.  It compares the avg births with the required sex-ed policies. 
# - This visualization is the most telling, showcasing the highest rates of teen pregnancy in states that have no or partial mandated sex-ed. 
# - It strongly points towards a correlation between sex-ed and teen pregancy, suggesting that mandated sex-ed will lower the teen pregancy rates in the U.S. 
# 
# **Note:** Adding the U.S. census data will take population into account and could provide additional insight into some of the figures we see right now. 
# 
# 
# **Machine learning plan:** We have not yet begun this module, so I cannot say what types of machine learning I will use or how I will make that happen.
